# Frontend Architecture

## Component Organization

The project follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/               # UI components from shadcn/ui and custom components
│   │   ├── dashboard/    # Specialized dashboard components
│   │   └── layout/       # Layout components (Header, SideNav, etc.)
├── hooks/                # Custom React hooks
├── integrations/         # External service integrations (Supabase)
├── lib/                  # Utility functions and helpers
└── pages/                # Page components for each route
```

### Component Types

1. **UI Components**: Reusable, presentational components (buttons, inputs, cards)
2. **Layout Components**: Structure-defining components (layouts, grids, containers)
3. **Feature Components**: Domain-specific components with business logic
4. **Page Components**: Route-specific components that compose other components

## State Management Strategy

The application uses a hybrid state management approach:

### Server State
- **TanStack Query (React Query)**: Manages all server-derived data
  - Query invalidation for data freshness
  - Optimistic updates for responsive UI
  - Prefetching for anticipated data needs
  - Caching with appropriate staleTime and cacheTime

### UI State
- **Component State**: Local state using React's useState for component-specific state
- **Context API**: Global state for theme, authentication, and application-wide settings
- **URL State**: State derived from URL parameters for shareable views

## Routing Architecture

React Router handles client-side routing with a hierarchical structure:

```
/                   # Dashboard
/landing            # Public landing page
/login              # User authentication
/signup             # New user registration
/enclosures         # List of all enclosures
/enclosure/:id      # Detailed view of specific enclosure
/animals            # List of all animals
/animal/:id         # Detailed animal record with weight history
/analytics          # Data visualization and reports
/schedule           # Task scheduling and calendar
/notifications      # System notifications and alerts
/alerts             # Critical alerts requiring attention
/settings           # System configuration and documentation
```

### Route Features
- **Nested Routes**: Hierarchical organization of related views
- **Protected Routes**: Authentication-gated access to secure areas
- **Lazy Loading**: Code splitting to load route components on demand
- **Route Guards**: Middleware-like checks before rendering routes

## Data Fetching Patterns

The application implements strategic data fetching patterns:

1. **Query-Based Fetching**: Using React Query for declarative data requests
2. **Pagination**: Efficient loading of large data sets with cursor-based pagination
3. **Infinite Scrolling**: Seamless data loading for continuous lists
4. **Search and Filtering**: Optimized fetching based on user-defined parameters
5. **Mutations**: Structured approach to updating server data

## Form Handling

Forms are managed using React Hook Form with:

1. **Zod Integration**: Schema-based validation with type inference
2. **Form Context**: Shared state for multi-step forms
3. **Field Arrays**: Handling dynamic input collections
4. **Form Submission**: Controlled submission with loading states and error handling

## Error Handling Strategy

Comprehensive approach to error management:

1. **API Error Handling**: Structured responses with error codes and messages
2. **Form Validation Errors**: Inline feedback with field-level messages
3. **Global Error Boundary**: Fallback UI for unexpected runtime errors
4. **Toast Notifications**: User-friendly error messaging
5. **Error Logging**: Capturing and reporting errors for monitoring

## Performance Optimization Techniques

Specific techniques implemented for frontend performance:

### Rendering Optimization
- **Memoization**: Strategic use of useMemo and React.memo
- **Virtualization**: Efficient rendering of large lists with react-window
- **Debounced Inputs**: Limiting re-renders on user typing
- **Deferred Rendering**: Non-critical UI elements rendered after main content

### Asset Optimization
- **Code Splitting**: Route and component-level splitting
- **Preloading**: Critical resources loaded early
- **Image Optimization**: Responsive images with proper sizing and formats
- **Font Loading Strategy**: Optimized web font loading with font-display

## Accessibility Considerations

The application prioritizes accessibility through:

1. **ARIA Attributes**: Proper semantic markup for assistive technologies
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Full functionality without mouse dependency
3. **Focus Management**: Logical tab order and focus indicators
4. **Color Contrast**: WCAG-compliant contrast ratios
5. **Screen Reader Support**: Text alternatives and semantic structure

## Responsive Design Approach

Multi-device support implemented with:

1. **Mobile-First Design**: Base styles for mobile with progressive enhancement
2. **Tailwind Breakpoints**: Consistent responsive breakpoints
3. **Component Adaptations**: Layout changes based on screen size
4. **Touch Interactions**: Support for touch gestures and events
5. **Viewport Considerations**: Meta tags and CSS handling for various devices
