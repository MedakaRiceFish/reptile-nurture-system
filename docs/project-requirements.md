## System Purpose

The Zoo Management System aims to solve key challenges faced by zookeepers and administrative staff by providing a unified platform for animal care, facility management, and operational efficiency. The system addresses the need for accurate record-keeping, environmental monitoring, and streamlined workflows in animal management facilities.

## Key Requirements

### Animals Management
- **Animal Database**: Complete profiles with species information, acquisition details, and images
- **Health Tracking**: Record observations, weight measurements, and health trends
- **Lineage Records**: Track breeding information and source/breeder details
- **Enclosure Assignment**: Flexible system for assigning animals to appropriate enclosures

### Enclosures Management
- **Enclosure Profiles**: Detailed information on size, type, and environmental parameters
- **Capacity Management**: Track current occupancy and available space
- **Environmental Controls**: Monitor and adjust temperature, humidity, and other parameters
- **Maintenance Tracking**: Schedule and document cleaning, repairs, and inspections

### Environmental Monitoring
- **Sensor Integration**: Connect with temperature, humidity, and other environmental sensors
- **Parameter Ranges**: Define acceptable ranges for different species requirements
- **Historical Data**: Track and visualize trends over time
- **Alert System**: Notify staff when parameters fall outside acceptable ranges

### Task Scheduling
- **Staff Assignments**: Assign and track responsibility for feeding, cleaning, and checks
- **Recurring Tasks**: Set up maintenance schedules and feeding routines
- **Calendar Integration**: View all upcoming tasks in calendar format
- **Mobile Notifications**: Remind staff of pending tasks and deadlines

### Analytics and Reporting
- **Health Trends**: Analyze animal weight and condition over time
- **Resource Utilization**: Track feed consumption and supply levels
- **Maintenance Efficiency**: Monitor completion rates and response times
- **Custom Reports**: Generate reports for regulatory compliance and internal review

### System Access and Security
- **Role-Based Access**: Different permissions for veterinarians, keepers, and administrators
- **Audit Trails**: Track changes to critical data
- **Data Backup**: Regular automated backups of all system data
- **Mobile Accessibility**: Secure access from mobile devices for field work

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- System should support at least 100 concurrent users
- Page load times should not exceed 2 seconds under normal conditions
- Search operations should return results in under 1 second

### Usability
- Intuitive interface requiring minimal training for staff
- Consistent design language across all screens
- Responsive design supporting desktop and mobile devices
- Comprehensive help documentation and tooltips

### Reliability
- System uptime of at least 99.9% during operating hours
- Automated data backup at least once per day
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

### Security
- Role-based access control for all system functions
- Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits and vulnerability testing
- Compliance with relevant data protection regulations

## Future Considerations

- Integration with veterinary record systems
- Public-facing exhibits information portal
- Advanced AI for predictive health monitoring
- Inventory management for supplies and feed
- Integration with IoT devices for automated environmental control
