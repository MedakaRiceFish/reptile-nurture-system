# Backend Structure

## Introduction

The backend forms the core engine of our zoo management system. It is dedicated to ensuring smooth operations across web and mobile devices. With a clear focus on reliability, security, and scalability, this backend supports animal and enclosure management, real-time environmental monitoring, extensive sensor data collection, and secure data synchronization. It is designed with an architecture that promotes effortless updates and future expansion, making it a critical component in delivering an intuitive and robust system for zoos and animal care facilities.

## Backend Architecture

Our backend is built using Supabase, providing a PostgreSQL database with built-in authentication and real-time capabilities. This design ensures that we can scale, maintain, and update the system without affecting the overall performance. The architecture is oriented to handle high volumes of time-series data from various enclosures and IoT devices using established design patterns. By leveraging Supabase's capabilities, the system can quickly adopt new features and services without lengthy integration cycles, which is essential for supporting both real-time environmental monitoring and asynchronous data handling for offline functionality.

## Database Management

Data storage is critical for our system. We use PostgreSQL through Supabase for all data, handling user accounts, animal profiles, enclosure configurations, environmental readings, and task scheduling. The database structure ensures data integrity and complex query support. Data is structured in a way that allows quick reads and writes. Tables are designed with appropriate relationships and indexes to optimize query performance. Regular maintenance practices such as backups and performance monitoring are in place to ensure optimal database operation.

## API Design and Endpoints

Our application employs a RESTful API structure for communication between the frontend and backend, supplemented by real-time subscriptions provided by Supabase for instantaneous updates and notifications. APIs follow industry standards and are designed with clear, consistent URL schemes. Core endpoints include those for user authentication, animal and enclosure management, environmental data retrieval, and task scheduling. Row-level security policies ensure that every API call is secure, meaning only authorized users can access or modify data. The clear documentation and consistent error handling make integration and debugging streamlined, even when coordinating between different interfaces like web clients and mobile apps.

## Hosting Solutions

The backend is hosted through Supabase's cloud infrastructure which delivers excellent scalability and performance. Our infrastructure leverages cloud instances that automatically scale to meet high demands during peak times, ensuring that environmental data collection, real-time updates, and user interactions run smoothly. This cloud-hosted solution not only provides high availability and cost-effectiveness but also integrates seamlessly with Supabase Storage for static file storage, such as animal images and document attachments. This hosting environment supports rapid deployment, secure operations, and efficient resource management, making it an optimal choice for both developmental and production phases.

## Infrastructure Components

Underlying our cloud hosting are several core infrastructure components. Load balancers distribute incoming traffic evenly, ensuring no single server becomes a bottleneck. Caching mechanisms speed up data retrieval for frequently requested information. These components work together to optimize performance, maintain high availability, and deliver data swiftly to users. The design ensures that even with high sensor data throughput and multiple concurrent user interactions, the system remains responsive.

## Security Measures

Security is a cornerstone of our backend design. We incorporate authentication options to add protection during user logins. Data in transit is secured using TLS encryption while data at rest is protected by Supabase's security measures. Our backend follows strict row-level security (RLS) patterns, ensuring that only permitted users can access sensitive data or perform operations. Regular security audits, prompt updates, and vulnerability patches are part of our ongoing practices to keep the system safe from emerging threats.

## Edge Functions and Server-Side Logic

Supabase Edge Functions provide server-side execution capabilities for complex business logic and integrations with external services. These functions are used for:

1. **Complex Data Processing**: Operations requiring multiple database interactions
2. **External Integrations**: Connecting with third-party APIs and services
3. **Scheduled Operations**: Background tasks and maintenance operations
4. **Security-Critical Operations**: Processes requiring server-side validation

Edge Functions are deployed alongside the application and can be triggered via HTTP endpoints or scheduled events.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

To ensure that our backend remains reliable and efficient, we employ a comprehensive suite of monitoring tools. These tools track performance metrics, system health, and error logs, providing real-time alerts if any component deviates from normal operation. Maintenance protocols include scheduled updates, automated backup processes, and routine security patches. Logging and performance dashboards help us understand system usage and adapt to changing load patterns, ensuring that prompt action is taken in case of any issues. This approach ensures continuous improvement and uptime maximization.

## Data Models

The system implements the following core data models:

### Animal
```typescript
interface Animal {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  species: string;
  age: string; // Often stored as descriptive text (e.g., "2 years")
  enclosureId: number;
  imageUrl?: string;
  weight: number; // Current weight in grams
  sex: 'Male' | 'Female' | 'Unknown';
  acquisitionDate?: string;
  breederSource?: string;
}
```

### Weight Record
```typescript
interface WeightRecord {
  date: string; // ISO date string
  weight: number; // Weight in grams
}
```

### Enclosure
```typescript
interface Enclosure {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  type: string;
  capacity: number;
  currentAnimals: number;
  status: 'Active' | 'Maintenance' | 'Inactive';
  lastCleaned?: string; // ISO date string
}
```

### Environmental Data
```typescript
interface EnvironmentalData {
  enclosureId: number;
  timestamp: string;
  temperature: number;
  humidity: number;
  lightLevel: number;
  waterQuality?: number;
  airflow?: number;
}
```

### Maintenance Record
```typescript
interface MaintenanceRecord {
  id: number;
  enclosureId: number;
  date: string;
  type: string;
  performedBy: string;
  notes?: string;
}
```

## Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

The backend structure is carefully designed to support our zoo management application with a focus on scalability, security, and high performance. It leverages Supabase for a robust and efficient architecture, providing authentication, database services, and real-time capabilities. APIs are designed to facilitate smooth communication between client interfaces and backend services, all secured with modern authentication and row-level security protocols. With integrated monitoring, infrastructure management, and optimization strategies, our backend is built to handle the unique demands of animal and enclosure management while keeping user experience at its forefront. This comprehensive approach not only meets current requirements but also positions the system for future enhancements, ensuring that our users have a secure, efficient, and responsive platform for managing their zoo operations.
